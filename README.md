## Feedback

1. In your second report, you studied the main categories of PDEs and how you can know if the PDEs are hyperbolic, parabolic, or elliptic. 

2. You did very well by studying heat equations and applying what you learned in week 1, and you coded it using python for 1D, 2D, and 3D.

3. Small note, you wrote in the report "Note that since the boundary conditions are functions of time, this means they will not be changing with time" is that true?

## Things I Need Help with 
*The main challenge I have faced this week is that I had to learn so many things at a time, as well as to do some search for another important task, whioch got me so distracted and confuced. I guess I need some more time process all what I have gained and to further arrange the report of this week and get it completed.*
