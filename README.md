# Internship Weekly Reports Draft

# Week 1
*June 23, 2022*

## Assigned tasks:
1. Set up the computer.
2. Complete Chapter 1 of Ref. (1).
3. Get fundamental CFD knowledge. 


## Highlights of the week:
- [A summary of what I have learned so far about FDM from Ch.1](https://github.com/Phatimah/SSI2022/blob/main/week1/Notes/Ch.1_Notes.pdf).
- [My attempts to get more familiar with Python and matplotlib for CFD](https://github.com/Phatimah/SSI2022/tree/main/week1/py).
- [Random informal notes for CFD](https://github.com/Phatimah/SSI2022/blob/main/week1/CFD%20lessons%20(Lorena%20A.%20Barba%20group).pdf).



## Progress updates:

1. I have read the first three sections of the first chapter of Ref. (1) thoroughly and skimmed over the remaining two. 
2. [Solved a couple of examples & exercises](https://github.com/Phatimah/SSI2022/tree/main/week1/examples).
3. Successfully set up Jupyter Notebook with Python 3 on Ubuntu and created a Python Virtual Environment for Jupyter.
4. Checked out some matplotlib tutorials and did some simple computations and plottings.
5. I have read the first chapter of Ref. (2) and watched some Youtube videos in an effort to gain a basic understanding of CFD.
6. [Uploaded all what I have done on GitHub](https://github.com/Phatimah/SSI2022/tree/main/week1). 


## In progress:
1. Setting up the computer.
2. Getting fundamental CFD knowledge.


## Things I Need Help with 
Nothing yet except for simple questions.

*The main challenge I faced last week was choosing which reference to look at out of the huge amount of references I have found.*
